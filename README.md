Classical Conditioning
Is where people learn through association. An unconditioned stimuli is first presented to the person along with a stimuli that naturally produces a behaviour (unconditioned response)
The unconditioned stimuli is then presented repeatedly with the stimuli that naturally produces a behaviour till the previously neutral stimuli(unconditioned stimuli) is now ASSOCIATED with the behaviour without the need of the other stimulus. Meaning the now conditioned stimuli,previously neutral stimuli, will now produce a conditioned reaction, which is the behaviour, without the need of the stimuli that naturally produced the behaviour.
